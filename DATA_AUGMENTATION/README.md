Here you can find various code for augmenting your data, mainly by scraping

* scr_reverso_extended.py - here I used selenium to visit a context reverso page for each word from a given list and scrape everything that appears on the screen: quick and dirty way to gather some data

* scr_dict_cc.py - again selenium but in this case I extract only specific words: I wrote this code to extract all the german words with tags - vulgar, rude, coll etc.
