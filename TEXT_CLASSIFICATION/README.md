# Ready to use classifier training scripts

In this directory you can find two training scripts for binary classifiers:

* [Naive_Bayes_classifier](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/TEXT_CLASSIFICATION/Naive_Bayes_classifier) - this script employs Naive Bayes to create a binary classifier. Thorough preprocessing is applied at training: weblinks, extraneous characters including hashtags and punctuation are deleted and lemmatization using Spacy is employed 

* [Transformer_classifier](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/TEXT_CLASSIFICATION/Transformer_classifier) - this directory contains scripts for training transformer based binary classifiers including a script for basic fine-tuning with early-stopping, fine-tuning with unbalanced data as well as adapter fine-tuning
