# Natural Language Processing Projects

This repository contains various finished or on-going projects involving Natural Language Processing (NLP).

* [DATA_AUGMENTATION](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/DATA_AUGMENTATION) - here you could find scripts intended for data augmentation using mostly Selenium and in some cases applying algorithmic approach to generating data, e.g. artificial CoLa

* [NER](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/NER) - in this directory there are scripts for training NER models and also running them in inference mode with extra feature - visualization of the displacy work in the html format

* [TEXT_CLASSIFICATION](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/TEXT_CLASSIFICATION) - similarly, here there are scripts for training binary text classificators including on unbalanced data as well as in the form of adapters

* [NLP_tools](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/NLP_tools) - miscellaneous custom NLP tools incluidng cosine similarity, extracting embeddings, some tools for working with embeddings and tools based on pymorphy2 and SpaCy

* [MASKED_LANGUAGE_MODELLING](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/MASKED_LANGUAGE_MODELLING) - at the moment, there is only a script for quick mlm model training, nothing fancy

* [CAUSAL_LANGUAGE_MODELLING](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/CAUSAL_LANGUAGE_MODELLING) - same as above but inference mode instructions

* [TOPIC_MODELLING](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/TOPIC_MODELLING) - at this folder you can find a class which generates vowpal type dataset which is supposed to be used in the unsupervised BigARTM model.
