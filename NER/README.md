# NER classification using transformer model

In this directory you can find two training scripts for binary classifiers:

* [CONLL_TO_HF](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/NER/CONLL_TO_HF) - this directory describes the pipeline to label data and a script for transforming CONLL format data into a huggingface dataset

* [TRAIN_FOR_NER]([https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/TEXT_CLASSIFICATION/Transformer_classifier](https://github.com/eistakovskii/NLP_projects/tree/main/NER/TRAIN_FOR_NER)) - this is a main directory for training a NER model and running it in a inference mode with the output visualization. The directory also contains a script for NER adapter training
